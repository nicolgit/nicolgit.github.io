# Directions

The apartment is in **VIA BALDASSARRE PERUZZI 19 00054 FIUMICINO**. 

If you're arriving by train, once you get to **PARCO LEONARDO** station, head towards the mall **The WOW Side** (cross the tracks if you're coming from the airport) and from there use Google Maps to get to the address, the distance is about 3/400 meters from the train station. Make sure the navigator doesn't take you around the one-way streets but takes you through the pedestrian plaza. 

> If you're arriving by car/Taxi/CAB/Uber, remember to clearly indicate to the driver **FIUMICINO** and not **ROME** üòÅ

Inside the 3d printer there is a security camera I have already disconnected and turned off for you, so your privascy.
