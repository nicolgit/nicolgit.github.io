Building Proximity was a technically simple idea on paper, but the process taught me many lessons — both about architecture and about using AI-assisted development.

# Highlights

* VS Code + Copilot accelerated development **enormously**.
* Writing C# code I already knew well, I went from hours to minutes on many tasks.
* For Vue and Leaflet, which were completely new to me, Copilot helped me scaffold components and learn the development paradigm quickly.
* Rapid prototyping and iteration became possible: I could test frontend-backend interactions without blocking myself on unfamiliar frameworks.
* Hands-on experience with new libraries: I now have a solid foundation in Vue and Leaflet, which will inform future projects.

# Lowlights

* At first, I let AI drive too much of the frontend implementation because I wanted to see what it would produce.
  * **Result**: some code is verbose, repetitive, or not as clean as I would have written manually.
  * **Lesson**: when using AI for new technologies, prepare focused, precise prompts for better results.
* Refactoring is still needed: even with AI, improving structure or fixing repeated patterns takes time.
  * Proper upfront design reduces refactoring and ensures maintainable code.

# Key takeaways

* AI can accelerate coding and learning, but it does not replace careful planning.
* Spend time upfront defining prompts, patterns, and architecture, especially with unfamiliar technologies.
* Iterating on real projects is the fastest way to learn frameworks and libraries.
* Trade-offs are unavoidable: balance speed, maintainability, and clarity.
* **The Proximity Project** became not just a tool, but a learning experience, combining architectural thinking, cloud deployment, and AI-assisted development.

# LINKEDIN 

Building Proximity taught me a lot about architecture, cloud deployment, and AI-assisted development:

* VS Code + Copilot accelerated coding in C# and helped me scaffold Vue + Leaflet components
* AI can speed up development, but upfront planning and precise prompts are key to maintainable code
* Refactoring is unavoidable, but manageable if the foundations are well set
* I wrote a short post reflecting on lessons learned from the project — what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently today.
