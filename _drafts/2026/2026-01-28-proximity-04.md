Proximity isn’t just about computing isochrones and displaying them.
Running it reliably and securely in the cloud requires careful architectural choices.

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

All resources are deployed using Infrastructure-as-Code written in **biceb**. Benefits:
* Reproducibility: environments can be recreated consistently
* Traceability: every change is tracked in source control
* Ease of iteration: no manual clicks, everything is declarative

# Azure network isolation

* All backend services run behind a private endpoint in an isolated Azure virtual network.
* Frontend accesses backend securely through this private link.
* System-assigned identities are used for authentication between services, eliminating the need for secrets in code.

Advantages:
* Strong security posture by default
* Minimizes attack surface
* Simplifies credential management and compliance

# CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Both frontend and backend are deployed automatically via 2 GitHub Actions:
1. Builds and deploys SPA to Azure Static Web Apps
2. Builds and deploys Azure Functions

Benefits:

* Fully automated workflow
* Fast and repeatable deployments
* Low operational overhead

In the next post, I’ll share lessons learned and what I’d do differently today, reflecting on both application design and infrastructure choices.

-----------------------

Deploying The Proximity project securely and reliably required more than just coding the isochrones.

It required deliberate infrastructure and security choices:

- Infrastructure-as-Code for reproducible environments
- Private endpoints & system-assigned identities for secure communication between frontend and backend
- GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD of the SPA and serverless functions

All this ensures a maintainable, secure, and cost-effective cloud deployment.

I wrote a short post diving into the infrastructure and deployment choices behind Proximity.
