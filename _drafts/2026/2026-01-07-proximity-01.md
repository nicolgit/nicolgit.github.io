excerpt: "Open source isn't a side activity for architects — it's a space where decisions can stand on their own, free from enterprise constraints. Here's why I continue building projects like Proximity as part of my architectural practice."

For me, open source is not a side activity, it's a deliberate part of how I practice code and architecture. This post explains why I continue to build and publish open source projects, and how Proximity fits into that approach.

In the enterprise environments I usually work in as a Cloud Architect, architecture is often constrained by existing platforms, organizational inertia, legacy decisions, political trade-offs.

> Those constraints are real — but they also limit experimentation.

Open source gives me a different space, a place with no hidden assumptions, no artificial deadlines, no "we'll fix it later in production" — every decision can stand on its own.

**The Proximity project** started exactly this way: it is an open source tool that visualizes walking-distance isochrones from public transport stops (trains, metro, buses) across multiple metropolitan areas and a **controlled environment** that allows me to apply patterns and learn to use frameworks that would otherwise remain somewhat sterile without a clear purpose.

In the next posts, I’ll go deeper into:

* the architectural problem behind it
* the decisions I made — and the ones I deliberately avoided
* what I’d do differently today

If you're **interested** in the project itself, in the meantime, you can find it here:

As a Cloud Architect, I don’t treat open source as a side activity.

In enterprise environments, architecture is often constrained by platforms, legacy, and organizational inertia. Open source gives me a different space — one where decisions can stand on their own.

Over the last months I’ve been working on "The Proximity project", an open source tool born exactly from this need.

I’ve written a short post explaining why I build open source as part of my architectural practice, and how Proximity fits into that approach.

Curious how other architects use open source in their own work.
