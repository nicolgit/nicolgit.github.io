excerpt: "Public transport accessibility isn't binary. What matters isn't just proximity to stops, but realistic walking distance. The Proximity project uses isochrones to visualize actual accessibility — revealing a deceptively complex technical challenge."

When talking about public transport accessibility, we often rely on simplified assumptions.

* Stops are either “served” or “not served”.
* Areas are either “covered” or “uncovered”.

In practice, accessibility is rarely binary.

What really affects usability is not the presence of a stop, but how far people can realistically walk to reach it. Five minutes on a flat sidewalk is very different from five minutes uphill.

Two stops 300 meters apart can serve very different areas.

> Straight-line distance doesn’t represent how people move.

What matters is the REAL walking time: Isochrones model this more accurately by showing where you can actually get to within a given walking time.

**The Proximity project** uses walking-distance isochrones to make this visible. The idea started from a simple Reddit post by someone who had created a similar visualization, which inspired me to build it.

This problem looks simple on the surface, but it quickly becomes non-trivial when you scale it:
* many cities
* many stops
* many transport type
* multiple distance thresholds
* interactive visualization on desktop and mobile browsers

It forces you to think about data modeling, computation cost, caching, and the frameworks to use.

> That’s exactly why I chose it.

In the next post, I’ll go into the architectural decisions behind, and why some obvious choices were deliberately avoided.

Public transport accessibility is often treated as a binary problem:
served vs not served.

In reality, what matters is walking distance — and how people actually move through the city.

This is the concrete problem behind Proximity: visualizing pedestrian accessibility using walking-distance isochrones across multiple metropolitan areas.

I wrote a short post explaining why this problem is more complex than it looks.
