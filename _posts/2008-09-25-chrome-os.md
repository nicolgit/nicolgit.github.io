<p>Yesterday evening I had the opportunity to read in detail the <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/" target="_blank">document that describe Google Chrome features</a>. Interesting is that if I read &quot;O.S.&quot; each time in the document appairs the word &quot;browser&quot; all the document continues to have sense. Very, very interesting:-)</p>
