<p>On Vista, even if is extremely easy to disable hibernation, re-activate or activate it for the first time, is an activity that you can do <strong>only via command line</strong>. While if you search on Live || Google you can find many answers to this question, my personal suggestion is to use information provided by Microsoft official support (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929658/" target="_blank">KB929658 - The Hibernate option is not available in Windows Vista</a>).</p>
